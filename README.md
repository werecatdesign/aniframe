AniFrame - Animate Your Digital Photo Frame
This is my attempt to create a digital animated photo frame. 
The user can upload an image to the website and this image receives a frame.
The frame of the image has a background colour that represents the dominant colour in the image.
The frame of the image is animated in anime.js. The motive of the animation depends on the most likely mood on the image.
